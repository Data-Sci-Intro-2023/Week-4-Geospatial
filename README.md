# Week 4: Geospatial data analysis and visualization

## Goals

In Week 1 you were introduced to spatial data types and working with them in R. This week you will dive deeper into analyzing and visualizing spatial data in R, and will be exposed to numerous R packages that allow you to access various open-source databases that contain spatial environmental data.

## Resources

Here are more resources on working with geospatial data in R: - [List of open-source geospatial datasets](https://github.com/giswqs/geospatial-data-catalogs) - [Visualize spatial data with `ggmap`](https://medium.com/appsilon-data-science/r-ggmap-how-to-visualize-spatial-data-in-r-c46dcf970095)

## Material/Assignment

There are 3 lesson plans this week. For each one, you can work off the **.Rmds** in the repo and enter your answers to the Exercises in there. Exercises are found throughout the lesson plan. Complete the lessons in this order:
