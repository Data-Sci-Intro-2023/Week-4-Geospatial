# Week 4: Geospatial data analysis and visualization

## Goals
In Week 1 you were introduced to spatial data types and working with them in R. This week you will dive deeper into analyzing and visualizing spatial data in R, and will be exposed to numerous R packages that allow you to access various open-source databases that contain spatial environmental data. 


## Resources
Here are more resources on working with geospatial data in R:
- [List of open-source geospatial datasets](https://github.com/giswqs/geospatial-data-catalogs)
- [Visualize spatial data with `ggmap`](https://medium.com/appsilon-data-science/r-ggmap-how-to-visualize-spatial-data-in-r-c46dcf970095)
